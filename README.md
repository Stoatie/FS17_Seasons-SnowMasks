You can use these snow masks by following the wiki
[wiki](https://github.com/RealismusModding/FS17_seasons/wiki/Info-for-Map-Makers)
on Seasons.

## Snow mask best practices

For the best results, you should mask the following:
- All roads that are not painted but use objects.
- All houses, sheds
- Everywhere there is tipCol. (You can use the tipCol as a base). This is neccessary
  for good gameplay, as snow can't be removed when there is a tipCol.

Placeables are masked automatically.
